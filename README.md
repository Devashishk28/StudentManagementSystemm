Just Completed My First Mini Java Project.

Iâ€™ve built a simple Student Management System using core Java concepts like: classes, objects, arrays,methods,etc.
This project allows users to add, display, and delete student records directly through the console.
It was a fun learning experience and helped me understand how object-oriented programming works in real-world scenarios.

Tech Stack: Java, Eclipse.
Excited to keep building and learning more!
